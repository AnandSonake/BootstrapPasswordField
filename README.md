# BootstrapPasswordField
Show/hides password field

This piece of code will add a checkbox to hide and show the value of password field.
You just need to add "data-bootstrappasswordfield-change" attribute to input field.

By adding a "data-*" attribute you are bootstrapping you password field to have ability to display its content based on the status of the checkbox.
